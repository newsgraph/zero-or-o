# zero-or-o
## for that rare annoying moment when you don't know which letter is which 

If you have to read out a text from the screen to someone, or read on one device and type on another, and you don't know if it's an l or an I, O or an 0.

Paste your text into the box [here](https://newsgraph.github.io/zero-or-o/) and it'll tell you.

I'm adding an image reading function soon.
